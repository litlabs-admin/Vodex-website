  },
  {
    question: "When should collections use voice reminders vs SMS or email?",
    answer:
      "Voice is best for time-sensitive and high-value reminders or where two-way interaction is needed (e.g., promise-to-pay). SMS/email works for low-value or informational reminders. Use a blended approach: voice for priority accounts, SMS/email for routine nudges.",
  },
  {
    question: "What security and data controls are required for US payment reminder programs?",
    answer:
      "AI payment reminder platforms should use encryption in transit & at rest, role-based access controls, retention policies, SOC2/ISO-aligned security, secure webhooks for payment posting, and detailed audit logs. For sensitive data like cardholder info, PCI compliance is typically handled by your payment processor or gateway, not the reminder platform itself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are automated payment reminder calls FDCPA/TCPA compliant in the US?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when the platform enforces US rules: time-of-day limits, consent/consent-revocation handling, scrub lists (DNC/Consent), configurable legal scripts, and call-record rules. Vodex supports FDCPA/TCPA settings to reduce compliance risk on reminder campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI voice agents verify Right-Party Contact (RPC) and reduce skip-tracing effort?",

  },
  {
    question: "How should I run a low-risk pilot of AI payment reminders in the US?",
    answer:
      "Pilot steps: (1) select a sample cohort (e.g., 1–2k accounts), (2) define KPIs (RPC, on-time payments, promises), (3) configure compliant scripts and call windows, (4) run for 4–6 weeks, (5) compare against control group and adjust. Report on DSO change and collection rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I scale automated payment reminder campaigns while staying compliant?",

  {
    question: "What is Promise-to-Pay (PTP) capture in debt collection?",
    answer:
      "Promise-to-Pay (PTP) capture refers to recording a borrower's commitment to make a payment on a specific date or through a structured plan. Accurate PTP capture is critical because it directly affects recovery forecasts, agent workflows, and compliance reporting. Platforms like Vodex automate the capture, confirmation, and CRM write-back of PTPs so teams always have up-to-date, audit-ready records.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are AI Voice Agents allowed to capture PTPs under federal and state collection rules?",
    answer:
      "Yes. AI Voice Agents are fully allowed to capture PTPs as long as they follow the same federal and state rules required of human collectors. In fact, AI often improves compliance because it never skips mandatory disclosures, mishandles consent, exceeds call-frequency limits, or dials outside approved windows. Vodex strengthens this even further with built-in script locking, real-time compliance guardrails, timestamped transcripts, and automatic DNC syncing ensuring every PTP is captured accurately, consistently, and in a fully auditable format.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI Voice Agents confirm or schedule payments during the same call?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Modern systems can negotiate simple payment details, confirm dates, and even trigger SMS or email reminders. Vodex's AI agents can schedule payment reminders, confirm commitments, trigger payment-portal links, and automatically update the borrower's next action in your system of record.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI Voice Agents reduce the cost of collecting PTPs?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Since PTP calls are high-volume but repetitive, AI can handle 60–80% of first-tier interactions at a fraction of the cost of human agents. Vodex customers typically shift the majority of low-complexity PTP conversations to Voice AI, reducing operational expenses while increasing actual commitments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does AI improve the quality and consistency of PTP follow-up?",
    answer:
      "Yes. AI ensures reminders, verifications, payment-link nudges, and callbacks happen exactly on schedule. Vodex automates the entire follow-up chain, triggering reminders, updating next-contact dates, and ensuring no PTP slips through the cracks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can AI Voice Agents improve PTP capture rates?",
    answer:
      "AI Voice Agents improve PTP capture by maintaining consistent scripts, asking follow-up questions reliably, and confirming payment details without error. They never rush the borrower, stay compliant, and preserve every intent signal. Vodex's Voice AI agents are specifically tuned for debt collection conversations and are trained to detect payment intent, verify borrower identity, and confirm payment dates with near-perfect consistency.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is AI-based PTP detection compared to human agents?",
